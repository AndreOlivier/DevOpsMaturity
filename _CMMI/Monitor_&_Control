"The term ""project plan"" refers to the overall plan for managing the project and includes a coherent description of who does what and when for creating, updating, or delivering a solution. The project plan can be a stand-alone document or distributed across multiple documents, and provides a way to track and communicate actual progress and determine if corrections are needed.

Tracking progress typically consists of comparing actual values to planned or estimated values for:

Size
Complexity
Effort
Cost
Schedule
Quality
Milestones
Knowledge and skills
Resources
Stakeholder involvement
Commitments
Transition to operations and support
Tracking actuals against estimates supports managing the expectations of customers and stakeholders. Take corrective actions when actual values deviate significantly from expected values. These corrective actions may include:

Revising the strategy for accomplishing the work
Updating objectives
Revising the plan
Revising the estimates
Establishing or modifying agreements and commitments
Updating risk management activities and work products
If corrective actions are required to resolve significant deviations from project plans, define and track these actions to closure."
