Estimating				
				
SUMMARY				
"Estimation provides the basis for making commitments. An estimate takes into consideration the scope, size, and complexity of the work. Base the estimate on the available information. Record any uncertainty as a risk.

Uncertainty or risk in a commitment can be handled by:

Providing an initial commitment with an understanding that the initial commitment may be changed if the scope changes Defining milestones to refine an initial commitment range to produce a final commitment after more investigation Committing to the known parts of the project, and committing to the remainder of the work after further investigation and definition Historical data describing the relationship between measured size and resources such as effort, cost, and schedule should be used when planning future work. A good understanding of historical data is critical to successful estimating. Use historical data when planning future work and to calibrate estimation formulas and models. Record qualitative information such as context, methods, tools and techniques used, and lessons learned from past projects.

Estimate and track several aspects of the work to realize value. For example, based on the table below, how complete is the work?"
